"""Move-selection logic for the Battlesnake (search version).

``choose_move`` runs a time-bounded minimax (paranoid: we assume the nearest
enemy moves to hurt us most) with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening.
A lightweight forward simulator applies Battlesnake rules each ply, and a
hand-written heuristic scores the leaves. Everything is wrapped so we always
return a legal-looking move within the time budget — a crash or a timeout means
no move, which means death.

Board coordinates: ``(0, 0)`` is the bottom-left corner.
