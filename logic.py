"""Search-based move-selection logic for the Battlesnake.

Replaces the 1-ply greedy evaluators from the `algo`/`ml` baselines with
iterative-deepening alpha-beta minimax: every turn we look several rounds
ahead (my move, a modeled "primary threat" enemy's reply, and the other
live snakes advanced by a cheap greedy heuristic) instead of just scoring
the four immediate neighbor cells once.

Everything still flows through :func:`choose_move`, which takes the raw
game state and returns one of ``"up" | "down" | "left" | "right"`` and can
never raise or return anything else -- if the search fails or runs out of
time it falls back to a simple, known-safe 1-ply heuristic.

Board coordinates: ``(0, 0)`` is the bottom-left corner.
  up    -> y + 1
  down  -> y - 1
  left  -> x - 1
  right -> x + 1
